# strategygame

## Introduction
Just a small terminal based strategy game, inspired by advance wars and wargroove.
This is meant for personal practice.

## The Game
It is a two player strategy game with different units and interactions between all of the units. 
The players earn money per round and can spend it in production facilities to recruit more units.

The goal is to destroy the main base of the opponent.

## Goals
First of all a playable game. Further down the road I would like to add AI enemies and maybe even a graphic representation of what is happening.
Additionally I would also like to use docker (have never used it before).
